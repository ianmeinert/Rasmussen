        <h1>You've got questions? We've got answers</h1>
        <h2>What Sizes and Thicknesses of Diapers are offered?</h2>

		<p>We offer 2 Sizes of Diapers and 6 Choices of thickness. The Newborn Size diapers are available in Newborn or Extra-Thick Newborn. Our experience has been that parents of babies who are 7 lbs or heavier seem to prefer the Extra-Thick Newborn diapers.</p>
		<p>We normally see your baby outgrow the Extra-Thick Newborn at about 17-18 lbs. Customers simply call to change their order to one of the Larger Size diapers : Light weight, Medium weight, Heavy weight, or Super Heavy weight. You may also mix and match your order to include up to 3 products at a time. We call this a Special Order.</p>
		<p>Special Orders are placed as a Percentage mix of your total order. For example, you might order 60% Extra Thick Newborn with 40% Super Heavy weight. Customers do not need to separate their soiled diapers by style. Our computer stores your ordered mix and calculates the correct mixture to return to you.</p>


		<h2>Can I have Diapers Delivered BEFORE my baby arrives?</h2>

		<p>Yes. We call this a Pre-Birth Delivery and we recommend this approximately 1-3 weeks ahead of your due date. Customers make payment for the first month of service and receive their entire first delivery. You then ACTIVATE your service by telephone when the Mother & Baby come home from the hospital and begin to use their diapers. There is NO CHARGE from the Pre-Birth Delivery date to the Service Activation date.</p>

 
		<h2>Can I suspend service for vacation periods?</h2>

		<p>Yes. Our credit policy makes it easy and convenient to suspend the service during holiday and vacation times. You receive a full credit for any week that you ask us to have the driver pick up your soiled diapers without delivering clean ones. This gets the soiled diapers out of your home during the time you are away.  And if you are away for an extended time you receive a full credit for any week that you ask us to skip your delivery.</p>
		<p>Your monthly statement clearly displays each service change, date, and credit amount.</p>


		<h2>I would like to give Bundles of Joy as a Gift. What are my options?</h2>

		<p>We offer two types of Gift Accounts and we provide Gift Certificates for both.  For many Shower Gifts, a specified number of weeks of service is prepaid. The most common gift service lasts 4 to 6 weeks, but you may prepay any number of weeks with a minimum of 4. We accept Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal.</p>
		<p>We also offer a Gift Billing Service where our monthly statement is mailed to the person paying for the gift. In this way, several months of service may be given without the inconvenience of a large initial payment.</p>
		<p>Gift Certificates can be mailed to the person giving the gift or can be mailed to the new parents signed from the person sending the gift. Gift Certificates are processed and mailed immediately.</p>
