	<h1>Our terms and conditions</h1>
	
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bundles of Joy will come to your home with samples of everything we offer; we will show you how to use our cloth diapers, explain how our service works, and answer any questions you might have.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to sign-up for service, a Bundles of Joy representative will drop off your first rotation of diapers.</li>
        <li>The first month of service is non-refundable and due prior to delivery.</li>
        <li>Bundles of Joy will provide diapers 1-3 weeks before your due date for expecting parents.  Give us a call or e-mail after your baby is born and we will activate your service and begin drop-off/pick-up on your designated delivery day.</li>
        <li>You have six weeks from the day your diapers are delivered during your orientation to cancel your service.  Once the six weeks are up, an invoices will automatically be generated and sent to your email address (or postal) with payment expected until service is cancelled.</li>
        <li>Delivery days are automatically assigned by location, so unfortunately customers may not choose a specific delivery day.</li>
	</ul> 
    
	<h2>Delivery Policies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Have your diapers out by 8:00am on your delivery day.</li>
        <li>Try to find a spot that is shaded or otherwise protected from the elements. Dirty diapers + heat and critters = upset neighbors.</li>
        <li>Bundles of Joy is not responsible for your diapers after they are delivered to your house. </li>
        <li>Damage from moisture or insects will be charged to your account ($2.00 per diaper, $20.00 per diaper bag).</li>
        <li>If your diapers are not available for pick-up when we arrive, we will knock on your door to try and retrieve them.  If nobody is home, we will be unable to leave your clean diapers without picking up the dirty ones.   We will leave a note on your door to let you know you missed your delivery.</li>
        <li>We will contact you via e-mail you to let you know you missed your delivery, but it is your responsibility to contact us if you would like to schedule an alternate day for service.  We can arrange to deliver your diapers on an alternate day for a small delivery fee of $5.00.</li>
        <li>Your baby doesn't take a break during the holidays; neither does our delivery service.</li>
    </ul>
 
	<h2>Changes in Service</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All changes in service must be made at least three days before your next scheduled delivery day.</li>
        <li>At Bundles of Joy, we understand that you'll be going out of town to show your baby off to friends and family. We are happy to pause your service for the time you will be out of town with at least three days notice.</li>
        <li>If you forget to let us know you will be out of town three days in advance, there will be a $5.00 service charge.</li>
        <li>Babies grow quickly!  If you are ready to change sizes, you can do that at any time with no charge, just give us three days so we can make sure we pack your bag appropriately.</li>
    </ul>
 
	<h2>Use and Care of Diapers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We pride in diaper doody; that's why we ask that you do not wash any of the diapers or the bag.  Any damage due to home laundering will be charged to your account ($2.00 per diaper, $20.00 per diaper bag).</li>
        <li>Do not use diaper creams that contain cod liver oil or zinc oxide since this can stain the diapers.</li>
        <li>Remeber that food consistancy goes in the same as it comes out. When your baby gets old enough to eat solids, remember to "flip" it into the toilet before putting the dirty diaper into the diaper bag. If at first you don't succeed, forget it; we'll take care of it for you.</li>
    </ul>
 
	<h2>Paying for Service</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment for the first month of service will be collected prior to your first delivery. The first monthâ€™s service is non-refundable.</li>
        <li>Following your first month of service, you will be charged weekly and invoiced monthly.</li>
        <li>Invoices will be emailed on the first business day of every month with account balances due in full by the 10th.</li>
    </ul>
 
	<h2>Canceling Service</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>Bundles of Joy understand that life changes occur and that your baby will one day be potty trained. Just give us at least one weeks notice of cancellation to prevent incurring another weeks charge.</li>
    	<li>All diapers and bags must be returned upon completion of service.  Missing or damaged items will be charged to your account ($2.00 per diaper, $20 per diaper bag).</li>
    </ul>
